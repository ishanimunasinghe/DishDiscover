## Overview: 
This is a full-stack web application for browsing recipes built with React on the front end and Node.js driving the back end. Various libraries such as Splide and Framer-Motion are used for smooth animations and interactive user interfaces while React-Router connects the components. 

Users have the ability to search for recipes, view instructions and ingredients, and filter recipes by categories (ie. by diet, cuisine, etc.).
